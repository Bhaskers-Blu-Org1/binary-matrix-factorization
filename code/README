To compile this code on linux type:
cd driver
make
cd ../heur
make
cd ../nlp
make

To run this code on linux you have to copy the three executables (driver, driver_heur, driver_nlp) into
the same directory. Then type: ./driver input_file_name.csv k a
where
k is a positive integer corresponding to the rank
a is 1 if you want to run algorithm 3 using algorithm 1 to generate an initial solution or
a is 2 if you want to run algorithm 3 using algorithm 2 to generate an initial solution

For example:
./driver ../data/random_type1/xRandom_n30_m30_k5_f2_v1.csv 5 1
